# Welcome to Genuine BS!

Inspired by project Genuine-fake, I decided to create a package to help people that have needs to create or test random large text functionality to save time and create random text.
You may find the details of the inspiring project link here: [https://pypi.org/project/Genuine-fake/]

## What does it do?

Just as the name suggest, it will produce completely random text (BS) in a common text format. Please note that at this phase of the project, grammar and semantics are in the scope, nor do I intend to add them in. The text from this package is completely random.

## Why

During my development time for the database, I realized that there are no existing easy methods to create random text strings to simulate real world content input. With that thought in mind, I decided to create this package for countering the situation.

## How to use it

### To install:

```markdown
$ pip install genuine-bs
```

### Usage

```markdown
import genuine-bs as bs

bs.rand_username()
bs.rand_version())
bs.rand_url()
bs.rand_ip()
bs.rand_list()
bs.rand_words()
bs.rand_sentence()
bs.rand_paragraph()
bs.rand_article()

```
